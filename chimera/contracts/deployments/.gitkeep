# Deployment Records Directory

This directory stores deployment records generated by the Deploy.s.sol script.

Each deployment creates a file named: `<network>-<timestamp>.txt`

Example: `testnet-1698765432.txt`

These files contain:
- Network name and chain ID
- Contract address
- Owner address
- Treasury address
- Deployment timestamp
- Block number

Keep these files for audit trail and reference.
