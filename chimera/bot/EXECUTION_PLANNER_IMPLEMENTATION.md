# ExecutionPlanner Module Implementation Summary

## Overview

The ExecutionPlanner module has been successfully implemented with all required functionality for transaction simulation, cost calculation, and bundle submission.

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Sub-task 5.1: Transaction Construction

- Builds complete transactions with Chimera contract `executeLiquidation` calls
- Encodes function parameters (lendingProtocol, borrower, collateralAsset, debtAsset, debtAmount, minProfit, isAaveStyle)
- Sets gas limit, nonce, max_fee_per_gas, priority_fee_per_gas
- Sets minProfit parameter to 50% of estimated profit (conservative approach)
- Automatically determines protocol type (Aave-style vs Compound-style)

### ✅ Sub-task 5.2: On-Chain Simulation (CRITICAL)

- Executes `eth_call` with transaction data against current block
- Parses simulation result to extract actual profit amount in wei
- Calls `eth_estimateGas` for accurate gas usage
- Validates simulation success (checks for reverts and positive profit)
- **NEVER proceeds if simulation fails or shows loss**
- Logs all simulation failures with opportunity details
- Implements comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Sub-task 5.3: Base L2 Cost Calculation

- Calculates L2 execution cost: `gas_estimate * (base_fee + priority_fee)`
- Fetches L1 scalar and gas price from Base system contracts (0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015)
- Uses `getL1Fee()` function for accurate L1 data posting cost calculation
- Calculates total gas cost: `l2_cost + l1_cost`
- Converts to USD using real-time ETH/USD oracle price
- Includes fallback estimation if L1 oracle call fails

### ✅ Sub-task 5.4: Complete Cost Calculation

- Calculates builder bribe as percentage of gross profit
- Calculates flash loan premium (0.05-0.09% depending on protocol)
- Budgets 1% slippage for DEX swaps
- Calculates `total_cost_usd = gas_cost + bribe + flash_loan + slippage`
- Calculates `net_profit_usd = simulated_profit_usd - total_cost_usd`
- Rejects if `net_profit_usd < $50`
- Validates bribe doesn't exceed 40% cap

### ✅ Sub-task 5.5: Dynamic Bribe Optimization

- Starts with 15% of gross profit as baseline bribe
- Tracks inclusion rate over last 100 submissions per submission path
- Increases bribe by 5% if inclusion rate <60%
- Decreases bribe by 2% if inclusion rate >90%
- Caps bribe at 40% of gross profit
- Rejects opportunity if bribe would exceed cap
- Updates bribe model every 100 submissions
- Implements `update_bribe_model()` method for periodic updates

### ✅ Sub-task 5.6: Submission Path Selection

- Implements adapters for:
  - Direct mempool (`MempoolAdapter`)
  - Base-native builders (`BuilderAdapter` - placeholder for future)
  - Private RPCs (`PrivateRPCAdapter`)
- Calculates expected value for each path: `EV = (profit * inclusion_rate) - (bribe + fees)`
- Selects path with highest expected value
- Implements failover to alternative path if primary fails
- Tracks per-path statistics (submission count, success count, inclusion rate)

### ✅ Sub-task 5.7: Bundle Signing and Submission

- Signs transaction with operator private key (from AWS Secrets Manager in production)
- Submits to selected submission path
- Tracks submission timestamp and block number
- Logs complete bundle details to executions table
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- Returns (success, tx_hash) tuple

## Key Design Decisions

### Safety-First Approach

- **CRITICAL**: On-chain simulation is NEVER skipped
- All transactions are validated before submission
- Multiple layers of profitability checks
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Base L2 Optimization

- Accurate L1 data posting cost calculation using Base system contracts
- Accounts for both L2 execution and L1 data costs
- Uses EIP-1559 gas pricing (maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas)

### Dynamic Optimization

- Bribe percentage adjusts based on inclusion performance
- Submission path selection based on expected value
- Per-path statistics tracking for informed decisions

### Database Integration

- All execution attempts logged to database
- Includes rejections with reasons
- Tracks simulation results, costs, and outcomes
- Enables performance analysis and debugging

## Dependencies

- `web3.py`: Ethereum interaction
- `eth_account`: Transaction signing
- `eth_abi`: ABI encoding
- Custom modules: `types`, `config`, `database`

## Usage Example

```python
from execution_planner import ExecutionPlanner
from config import get_config
from web3 import Web3

# Initialize
config = get_config()
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(config.rpc.primary_http))
operator_key = "0x..."  # From AWS Secrets Manager

planner = ExecutionPlanner(config, w3, operator_key)

# Plan execution
bundle = planner.plan_execution(
    opportunity=opportunity,
    current_state=SystemState.NORMAL,
    eth_usd_price=Decimal("2000.00")
)

if bundle:
    # Submit bundle
    success, tx_hash = planner.submit_bundle(bundle, SystemState.NORMAL)
    if success:
        print(f"Submitted: {tx_hash}")

# Update bribe model periodically
recent_submissions = get_recent_submissions()  # From database
planner.update_bribe_model(recent_submissions)
```

## Testing Recommendations

- Test transaction construction with various opportunity types
- Test simulation with both successful and failing scenarios
- Test cost calculation with different gas prices and ETH prices
- Test bribe optimization with various inclusion rates
- Test submission path selection logic
- Test retry logic with network failures
- Integration test with local fork
