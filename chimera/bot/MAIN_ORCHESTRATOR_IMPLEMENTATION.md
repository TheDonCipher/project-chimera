# Main Bot Orchestrator Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 7: "Implement main bot orchestrator and integration" for the Chimera MEV liquidation bot.

## Implementation Summary

### Task 7.1: Create Main Bot Orchestrator ✓

**File**: `chimera/bot/src/main.py`

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Configuration Loading**

   - Loads configuration from `config.yaml` and environment variables
   - Validates all required configuration parameters

2. **Database Connections**

   - Initializes PostgreSQL connection with connection pooling
   - Initializes Redis connection with fallback to in-memory cache
   - Performs health checks on both connections

3. **RPC Provider Connections**

   - Connects to primary HTTP RPC provider
   - Configures backup RPC provider for failover
   - Verifies connectivity and fetches current block number

4. **Smart Contract Verification**

   - Verifies Chimera contract exists at configured address
   - Loads contract ABI for interaction

5. **Operator Wallet Verification**

   - Retrieves operator private key from environment variable
   - Checks operator wallet balance
   - Ensures minimum balance of 0.1 ETH for gas

6. **Module Initialization**
   - Initializes `StateEngine` for blockchain state synchronization
   - Initializes `OpportunityDetector` for liquidation opportunity identification
   - Initializes `ExecutionPlanner` for transaction simulation and bundle construction
   - Initializes `SafetyController` for limit enforcement and state management

### Task 7.2: Implement Main Event Loop ✓

**Implementation Details**:

1. **State Checking**

   - Checks `SafetyController` state before each cycle
   - Skips execution if system is HALTED
   - Applies 50% throttling if system is THROTTLED

2. **Opportunity Scanning**

   - Retrieves all positions from `StateEngine` cache
   - Checks each position for liquidation opportunity via `OpportunityDetector`
   - Tracks number of opportunities detected

3. **Execution Planning**

   - Gets current ETH/USD price for cost calculation
   - Plans execution via `ExecutionPlanner` (includes simulation)
   - Validates profitability and cost estimates

4. **Safety Validation**

   - Validates execution against safety limits via `SafetyController`
   - Checks single execution limit, daily volume limit, minimum profit

5. **Bundle Submission**

   - Submits profitable bundles via `ExecutionPlanner`
   - Tracks submission success/failure
   - Records execution attempts to database

6. **Performance Metrics**
   - Updates bribe optimization model every 100 submissions
   - Triggers state transitions based on performance metrics
   - Maintains 5-second scan interval

### Task 7.3: Implement Error Handling and Graceful Degradation ✓

**Implementation Details**:

1. **RPC Error Handling**

   - Catches RPC connection errors
   - Automatically switches to backup RPC provider
   - Enters HALTED state if all providers fail
   - Attempts to reconnect to primary provider periodically

2. **Database Error Handling**

   - Catches database connection errors
   - Queues operations in memory (max 100 items)
   - Attempts to flush queue when database reconnects
   - Drops oldest non-critical operations if queue is full

3. **Unexpected Exception Handling**

   - Catches all exceptions in main loop
   - Logs with full stack trace
   - Continues execution (never crashes main loop)
   - Tracks consecutive errors

4. **Critical Error Handling**

   - Enters HALTED state after 10 consecutive errors
   - Prevents catastrophic failures
   - Requires manual operator intervention to resume

5. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Continues with empty position list if StateEngine fails
   - Uses fallback ETH price if oracle fetch fails
   - Skips failed opportunities and continues with next
   - Continues execution even if metrics update fails

### Task 7.4: Implement Monitoring Integration ✓

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Metrics Export**

   - Exports metrics every 60 seconds (configurable)
   - Includes system state, opportunities detected, bundles submitted
   - Includes inclusion rate, simulation accuracy, daily volume
   - Includes consecutive failures, positions cached, current block

2. **CloudWatch Integration**

   - Placeholder for CloudWatch metrics export
   - Would use `boto3.client('cloudwatch').put_metric_data()`
   - Configurable via `monitoring.cloudwatch_enabled`

3. **Alert Conditions**

   - **CRITICAL**: HALTED state, operator balance < 0.1 ETH
   - **HIGH**: THROTTLED state, inclusion rate < 50%, consecutive failures ≥ 2
   - **MEDIUM**: Daily volume > 80% of limit
   - **LOW**: Daily summaries (not yet implemented)

4. **Alert Channels**
   - Logs all alerts with severity level
   - Placeholder for SNS/PagerDuty/email integration
   - Configurable alert destinations in config

## Key Features

### ChimeraBot Class

The main orchestrator class that manages all bot operations:

- **Initialization**: Sets up all modules and connections
- **Start/Stop**: Manages bot lifecycle
- **Main Event Loop**: Scans for opportunities and executes profitable ones
- **Monitoring Loop**: Exports metrics and checks alert conditions
- **Error Handling**: Handles RPC, database, and unexpected errors
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Responds to SIGINT/SIGTERM signals

### Error Recovery

The implementation includes multiple layers of error recovery:

1. **RPC Failover**: Automatic switch to backup provider
2. **Database Queueing**: In-memory queue during outages
3. **Consecutive Error Tracking**: Prevents infinite error loops
4. **State Machine**: HALTED state for critical errors
5. **Never Crash**: Main loop continues even on errors

### Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring and alerting:

1. **Real-time Metrics**: Exported every 60 seconds
2. **Performance Tracking**: Inclusion rate, simulation accuracy
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Operator balance, daily volume
4. **Alert Levels**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
5. **Configurable**: All thresholds and channels configurable

## Testing

### Integration Test

**File**: `chimera/bot/test_main_integration.py`

Tests verify:

1. Main module can be imported
2. All required modules can be imported

export DB_PASSWORD="..."

# Run the bot
cd chimera/bot/src
python -m bot.src.main

# Send SIGINT
Ctrl+C

# Or send SIGTERM
kill -TERM <pid>
```
